  <h1>Radial Engine</h1>

  <!-- 3 paragraphs – what a radial engine is / how it works -->
  <p class="lead">
    A radial engine is a type of internal combustion engine where multiple cylinders are arranged in a circle around a
    central crankshaft. This design became iconic in early aviation—used in fighter aircraft, transport planes, and
    trainers—because the circular cylinder layout delivered strong power, excellent air cooling, and outstanding
    reliability in demanding environments.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    As the crankshaft rotates, the pistons fire in a precise sequence that produces smooth, continuous torque. The
    connecting rods use a distinctive “master rod and link rod” system, allowing all cylinders to drive a single crank
    pin while maintaining synchronized motion. This creates the signature rotating pattern that makes radial engines
    both mechanically efficient and visually fascinating.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Although largely replaced by modern turbine engines, the radial engine remains a classic example of mechanical
    ingenuity and multi-cylinder coordination. Its simple yet effective design continues to be used for education,
    restoration projects, and engineering demonstrations.

  <!-- Your project summary -->
  <p class="project-summary-title">
    Multi-cylinder engine assembly modelled and animated in SolidWorks.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    This radial engine project focuses on building a complete multi-cylinder assembly, applying correct mates and then
    driving a motion study to visualise piston and crank kinematics. It is designed and modelled entirely in SolidWorks.
